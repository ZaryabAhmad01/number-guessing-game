# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple Python terminal game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program gives a hint:
  - "Lower number please" if the guess is too high.
  - "Higher number please" if the guess is too low.
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed.
- The total number of attempts is displayed.
